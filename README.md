# My Journey to Data & AI

Hi!
This repository documents my learning journey from basic Python to Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

## Career Goal
Within the next few years, I aim to work in a role involving:
- Coding
- Data processing
- Data analysis
- Machine Learning / AI

I come from a Physics background and have experience in instrumentation and electronics.  
Now I am building strong foundations in Python and Data Science to transition into a data-focused career.
